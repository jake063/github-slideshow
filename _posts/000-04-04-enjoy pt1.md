A large majority or around 60% of my time is spent watching people on youtube having more fun than I am.
My favorite youtubers are 

Markiplier, He plays videogames with humorous commentary.
Linus Tech Tips, A tech wizard who spends too much money on computers.
The Hacksmith, A Canadian engineer on a quest to create a IRL Stark Industries
